# This exercise will have you trying out TypeScript as it would in real life!

### Your goal is to create a simple project:

*Main goals are:*
    - A simple express server, which holds an object of users (this is given to you), and something the users own, like ducks! (You can do something other than ducks :) )
    - An API for the server ("\login")
    - the abillity to login 
    - `GET` ducks by user, if he is logged in

*NOTE:* You don't need to have an actual DB for the `Main goals`. You can have a `constant object` of your users and ducks, your goal is to practice writing the types for them, and implementing it in a real server

*If you've got more time, you can add:*
    - A "\register" API endpoint 
    - Connection to MySQL, with tables 
    - Build a Cute Front-End!
    - Make it your own!!! Add barbies, aliens or propaganda!
