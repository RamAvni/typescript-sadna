Hiiiiiiiiiiii
In order to start doing the exercises:

1.  (Since these small exercises will make you fix type-errors, that means when trying compile, there's, ahmm, well.. errors!)
    So I commented them out for you-
    Uncomment the exercise you want to do, and continue :)

2.  Include only the exercise you want to run in the main `index.ts` file:
    `import "./src/exercises/1";`

3.  At the root of the project, do:

```bash
   pnpm tsc

```

4. Great! you have javascript files! Now find the exercise file you want to run, and run it with `node`!

NOTE:
If you have tab-autocomplete, remove it!!
